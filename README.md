Team Name: HMC

# Project Description

This project is a website which will be made using html, css, and javascript to create an interactive single player rock paper scissors game in which the player competes against the server in a best of 3 match. The user's and the server's victories will be tracked and shown to the user on the screen. Players will have the option of selecting one of three distinct graphic themes for the game. Players will be greeted with a homepage, a page where they may play the game, and an about page where they can learn more about the game and its history. A simple animation will notify players if they have won or lost a round. A leaderboard which tracks users wins will also be displayed on the homepage.
