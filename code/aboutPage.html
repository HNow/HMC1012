        <p> Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game which has been around for longer than you can imagine!<br> 
          This website aims to replicate the game through HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
          In single player mode you choose between three options, rock, paper, and scissors<br>
        rock beats scissors,scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. With these rules in mind <br>
      you can get straight to playing the game now against the server if you wish! <br>
    The servers choices are completely random and you are told what you and the server <br>
  chose after each turn. Games are played <b> best out of three</b>, with the winner gaining one point on the baord. <br><br>
Whether you are playing this game for a high score, to settle a decision, or just for enjoyment, good luck, and have fun! </p>
